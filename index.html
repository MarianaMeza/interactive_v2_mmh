    <h1>Behind the deadliest year in Mexico </h1>
    <p>Mexico has recorded its highest homicide rate in years, with a total of 31,902 murders in 2017, more than in 2011 at the peak of Mexico’s drug cartel-stoked violence. The death toll is Mexico’s highest since the government began keeping records in 1997, and shot past 2011’s tally of 27,213 homicides. According to the Interior Department, Mexico’s homicide rate this past year equated with 20.5 murders per 100,000 residents; in 2011, that figure was 19.4. Compared to the statistics from 2016, every state in Mexico (with the exception of Sonora, which borders Arizona, and Morelos, located south of Mexico City) saw an increase in the number of executions related to organized crime. The states with the highest number of killings were Guerrero, Guanajuato, Veracruz, Michoacán, Chihuahua and Baja California. </p>
